## Hi there! Anderson here! :wave:

Senior Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience building scalable web applications across Brazil, the United States, and Europe.

I specialize in modern JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystems, with strong expertise in React, NestJS, and Node.js, designing robust front-end architectures and high-performance backend services. I’ve worked in distributed international teams delivering cloud-native systems with strong architectural foundations.

I consider myself an AI-first developer.

AI is not a side experiment in my workflow — it is a daily engineering tool. I leverage AI to:
- Accelerate prototyping and feature delivery
- Improve code quality and refactoring strategies
- Generate and validate architectural alternatives
- Enhance documentation and technical clarity
- Increase productivity without compromising standards

Rather than replacing engineering judgment, AI amplifies it. I use it as a force multiplier to deliver faster, cleaner, and more scalable solutions.

Core Expertise
- Frontend Engineering: React, modern JavaScript (ES6+), component-driven architecture
- Backend Engineering: NestJS, Node.js, RESTful APIs
- Cloud & DevOps: AWS, Docker, CI/CD
- Architecture: Modular systems, API-first design, scalable services
- AI-Assisted Development: Prompt engineering for development workflows, code optimization, solution modeling

I value clean architecture, strong typing, maintainability, and pragmatic engineering decisions that generate real business impact.

If you're building ambitious products and want an engineer who combines solid fundamentals with AI-augmented execution — let’s connect.
